Customer has made loose observation that “since Tanium was installed my battery life has been worse’. While we haven’t been provided any actual metrics or evidence at this point the observation is being made by the CSO at a time when Tanium seems to be getting blamed for _any_ issue that arises. Their conclusion is based on seeing OSX FW using more battery and lots of logs for the FW around Tanium :confused: With that, they are now asking for Tanium best practice to whitelist Tanium client with the OSX firewall. Seems to me that port based exception might be a good option but wanted to see if anyone else has thoughts/ideas/recommendations?",

(This was filed by the golang folks <https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13470>).\n\nIn this specific case, the shared-library instance of libc won’t initialize the required ctypes data if the statically-linked libc has already created a thread. libc only ever expects there to be one instance in memory at a time, so they’ve no way to accommodate for one-another. \n\nThe maintainers of libc *don’t* know how to fix the issue, as there are other problems associated with having both a statically-linked libc and shared-library libc in memory at the same time. They recommend dynamically linking to libc rather than statically, and go on further to suggest that if you are going to statically link, that should be limited to being done within binaries that do not make heavy usage of the libc feature set.",
